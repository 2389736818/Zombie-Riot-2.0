# Zombie-Riot-2.0
Now that zriot has not been updated for a long time, I decided to build a new version . I need the following help : 1.The add to zadmin command to zmenu. 2.Add '!zspawn' to zmenu menu. 3.Repair market in the menu menu does not display the bug.  In the zadmin menu you can use the following command : 1. Turn the player into zombie . 2. Turn the player into human . 3. You can directly convert days in the zadmin menu .   Of course, this is just some of my thoughts,This requires your help.  Successfully achieved： 1.Can type '! zmenu' menu 2. '!zmenu' menu can only use'! zstack command .  Known bug： 1.Use '!ztele' command may not be transferred to the spawn point. 2.Use '!zclass' menu may be forced to replace the days set in the zombie models.  About the code： 1.I used the ZR2.5 code to update Zriot 2.I also had other ideas to update the riot, but all failed.
